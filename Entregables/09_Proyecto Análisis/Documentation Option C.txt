1.Document all steps. Structure your code to keep it cleaned using  good practices.
2.Use Trello to manage your project
3.The dashboard created must have at least three menu sections. 
	The first one is the welcome
	the second one is related to visualize your cleaned data 
	the third one must call your own flask API and show the json returned.

4.Collect the data. Try to do that each call, it collects the last updated data.
Since the data are quite static (elections 2019 and 2021, population in 2020 -last 

5.Determine and explain if the data is cleaned. If not,then clean it.
The data has been created in order to be mainly clean, however, there are columns unnecessary so they are droped from the main table such as all the original values from eah election (2019 and 2021)

6.Show different tendencies for each column in your dataset.
the main tendency to be analyzed is the PP vote. For this values there are several columns that show a significative correlation:
	- D-Contabilizados 	(+0.64)
	- D-Abstenciones	(-0.64) -> correlación directa entre Cont y Abs
	- D-MÁS MADRID		(-0.49)
	- D-VOX			(-0.49)
	- D-Cs			(-0.75)

7.Represent, in a pie chart, the time you have needed for each point in the The project steps section.
	searching the data:
		a CAM election in 2021: 1h
		b CAM election in 2019: 2h
		c Restaurants/bars/pubs: 2h+
		d1 coding the dataframe generation for the CAM election results: 6h00
		d2 research + coding the dataframe generation for the population: 1h30
		d3 research + cleanning + coding the dataframe for act. in MAdrid: 1:30
		e organization/reading documentation for the project: 30min
		f writing the documentation for the job done: 20min

8.Show five graphs in which you can conclude your hypothesis
9.Answer the questions:
	a.Was it possible to demonstrate the hypothesis? Why?
	b.What can you conclude about your data study?
	c.What would you change if you need to do another EDAproject?
	d.What do you learn doing this project?6
